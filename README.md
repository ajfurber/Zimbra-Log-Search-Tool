# Zimbra Log Searcher

### What does this tool do?
This tool is used to help new Zimbra Administrators filter and search their mail logs to find the correct messages.

### How does this tool work?
This tool simply makes use of the existing zmmsgtrace (https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/CLI_zmmsgtrace) utility, but helps administrators by selecting and filling the correct paramaters for them.

## What rights do I need?
Typically this should be run as the zimbra user, as by default this is who the log files are owned by.
